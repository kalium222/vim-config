# Vim config

This is a personal vim config. Just put all the things in the `~/.vim`.
Use `vim-plug` as plugin manager.

## lsp

Use [`vim-lsp`](https://github.com/prabirshrestha/vim-lsp) for lsp support. 
1. `clangd` for `c/cpp`.
2. `pylsp` for `python`. Here is the [repo](https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server).
